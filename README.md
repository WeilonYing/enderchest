Simple S3 uploader written in Python

# Setup

This was written for Python 3.6. Using Pipenv is recommended, but you should be able to get this running as long as you have `boto3` installed.

## Set your environment variables
If you're using Pipenv, copy .env.template to .env and set the variable names. Otherwise, look at .env.template for what environment variables you need to set.
